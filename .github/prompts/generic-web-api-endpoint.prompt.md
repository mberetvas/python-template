# Web API Endpoint Implementation

**Directive:** Design a function to handle a web API endpoint request. If no framework is specified, use the standard library `http.server` as a base.

**Requirements:**
- Define the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST) and URL path.
- Document the expected JSON request body and successful JSON response format.
- Implement logic to parse and validate the incoming request.
- Handle success (200 OK) and error states (400 Bad Request, 500 Internal Server Error) with appropriate JSON responses.
- Isolate the core business logic from the web request/response handling.
- Include a docstring that explains the endpoint's purpose, parameters, and potential responses.
