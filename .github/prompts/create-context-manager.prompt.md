# Context Manager Creation

Implement context manager:

- Create class with __enter__ and __exit__ methods
- Handle resource acquisition and cleanup
- Implement proper exception handling in __exit__
- Create function-based context manager using contextlib
- Demonstrate usage with 'with' statement
- Ensure resources are cleaned up even on errors
