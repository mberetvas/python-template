# Task: Generate a Python Class

Based on the following requirements, please generate a Python class.

**Requirements:**
- Class Name: `${input:ClassName}`
- Description: `${input:ClassDescription}`

**Instructions:**
1.  The class must include an `__init__` method.
2.  All method arguments and return types must have PEP 484 type hints.
3.  Generate a Google-style docstring for the class and its `__init__` method.
4.  Include placeholder methods if the description implies behavior (e.g., `load_data`, `process_item`).
5.  Adhere to PEP 8 standards.
6.  Reference our project's conventions: [my-python-style.instructions.md]
