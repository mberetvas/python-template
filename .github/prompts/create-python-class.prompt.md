# Python Class Implementation

**Directive:** Create a Python class that adheres to the following structure and best practices.

**Guidelines:**
- Use PascalCase for the class name.
- Implement the `__init__` method with type-hinted parameters.
- Implement `__repr__` and `__str__` methods for clear object representation.
- Include at least two public methods with full type hints and Google-style docstrings.
- Use `@property` for attributes that require controlled access (getters).
- Implement basic input validation in the `__init__` method, raising `ValueError` for invalid arguments.
- Include a usage example within a docstring or as a commented-out block.
