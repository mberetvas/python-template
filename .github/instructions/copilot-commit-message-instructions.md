# GitHub Copilot: Conventional Commit Instructions

Your task is to act as an expert at writing commit messages that strictly follow the **Conventional Commits v1.0.0 specification**. Based on the user's description of their code changes, you will generate a perfectly formatted commit message.

---

## 1. The Commit Structure

Every commit message must follow this format:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

---

## 2. Components Explained

### **Type**

The `type` MUST be one of the following lowercase keywords. This is the most important part of the commit.

*   **feat**: A new feature for the user.
*   **fix**: A bug fix for the user.
*   **docs**: Documentation only changes.
*   **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc).
*   **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
*   **perf**: A code change that improves performance.
*   **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
*   **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm).
*   **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs).
*   **chore**: Other changes that don't modify `src` or `test` files. General maintenance.

### **Scope (Optional)**

A `scope` is a noun in parentheses that provides additional contextual information. It describes the section of the codebase the commit changes.
*   Examples: `(api)`, `(auth)`, `(db)`, `(ui)`, `(parser)`.
*   If the changes are widespread, omit the scope.

### **Description**

The description is a short summary of the code changes. It MUST:
*   Immediately follow the colon and space after the `type` or `scope`.
*   Be in the **imperative, present tense** (e.g., "change", not "changed" or "changes").
*   **Not** be capitalized.
*   **Not** end with a period.

### **Body (Optional)**

The body is for providing additional context, motivation for the change, and contrasts with previous behavior.
*   It MUST be separated from the description by one blank line.
*   Use it to explain the "what" and "why" vs. the "how".
*   Like the description, use the imperative, present tense.

### **Footer(s) (Optional)**

Footers are for tracking metadata.
*   They MUST be separated from the body by one blank line.
*   **Breaking Changes:** The most important footer is `BREAKING CHANGE:`, which is a required section if the commit introduces a breaking API change. It must be followed by a detailed description of the change.
*   **Referencing Issues:** Use keywords to reference issues (e.g., `Closes #123`, `Fixes #45`, `Resolves #99`).

## 3. Handling Breaking Changes

A breaking change is a commit that changes the API in a way that is not backward-compatible. You MUST indicate this in one of two ways:

1.  **Append `!` to the type/scope:** This draws immediate attention to the breaking change.
    *   `feat(api)!: remove deprecated user endpoint`
2.  **Add a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer:** This is required and provides a detailed explanation.
    *   If using the `!` in the header, a `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer is still required in the footer.

---

## 4. Examples

Here are examples for you to learn from.

**Example 1: Simple fix with scope**

```
fix(auth): correct password hashing on user login
```

**Example 2: New documentation feature with a body**

```
docs: add guide for deploying to production

This new guide provides step-by-step instructions for a production
deployment, including environment variable setup and database migrations.
```

**Example 3: A refactor that introduces a breaking change**

```
refactor(auth)!: switch from JWT sessions to server-side sessions

BREAKING CHANGE: The authentication API no longer returns a JWT token.
Clients must now handle cookies for session management. The `/api/refresh-token`
endpoint has been removed.
```

**Example 4: A chore that closes an issue**

```
chore(deps): update all non-major dependencies

Resolves #215
```

**Example 5: A performance improvement**

```
perf: optimize image loading by using lazy-loading
```

## Your Task

Now, based on the user's input describing their changes, generate a complete and concise Conventional Commit message following all the rules above.
