## Overview

This repository provides a general-purpose Python template, including a basic setup and recommended folder structure. It is designed to help you quickly start new Python projects with best practices in mind.

## Features

- Organized folder structure (`src/` for source code)
- Example entry point (`main.py`)
- Organized folder structure (`tests/` for tests code)
- Ready for version control
- Easy to extend for larger projects

## Folder Structure

```text
python-template/
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── src/
│   └── main.py
├── tests/
    └── tests.py
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-template.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd python-template
   ```
3. (Optional) Install development dependencies, including pytest for testing:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Start developing your Python project in the `src/` folder.

## Using uv (Astral Package Manager)

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is an extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust. It is recommended to use uv for managing dependencies and virtual environments in this project.

To create a new uv-managed virtual environment and install dependencies:

```sh
uv venv .venv
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

For more details, see the [uv documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

## Usage

Run the entry point script:

```sh
python src/main.py
```

## Testing

Run all tests with pytest:

```sh
pytest
```

## Code Quality

Check code quality with Ruff:

```sh
ruff check src/ tests/
```
